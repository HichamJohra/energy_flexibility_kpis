dataset:
    filepath: /filepath/to/dataset # [REQUIRED] Absolute filepath to dataset.
    resolution:
        temporal_resolution: 60 # [REQUIRED] Time resolution of dataset in seconds.
        spatial_resolution:
            single_resource: true # [REQUIRED] Set to true if the dataset is for a single building or DER otherwise, false.
    
    # [OPTIONAL] Use the <variable_name> to map custom dataset variable name to EFont variable name (<>).
    # Replace the value for the following variable name keys with the custom variable names in your dataset
    # where applicable. By the default, it is assumed that your custom dataset uses EFont's variable naming
    # convention. Any other variables in your dataset that cannot be mapped to the EFont variables will be
    # ignored and cannot be used for calculations at this time.
